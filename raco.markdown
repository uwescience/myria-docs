# Raco query frontend and middleware

(This document is still a WIP)

[Raco](https://github.com/uwescience/raco) parses query languages, optimizes query plans, and compiles plans to representations accepted by query processing systems.

## Command line usage

`scripts/myrial` provides provides Raco functionality on the command line.

```bash
# help
scripts/myrial -h

# generate a logical plan for a MyriaL query in examples/
scripts/myrial -l examples/join.myl

# see the physical plan, MyriaX is the default algebra to use
scripts/myrial examples/join.myl

# Raco requires a catalog for MyriaL queries. All of the example queries
# use a catalog given in examples/catalog.py. See examples/catalog.py and raco/catalog.py for formatting information.
# scripts/myrial automatically searches for a catalog.py in the same directory
# as the provided query. You can also provide a custom path.
scripts/myrial --catalog=examples/catalog.py -l examples/join.myl

# (soon) you will also be able to specify a url of a json catalog
# or the url of a myria instance
TODO

# get the JSON used to submit the query plan to MyriaX REST interface
scripts/myrial -j example/join.myl

# There is also a python string representation of the query plan. This is valid
# python code that you can give back to Raco.

```

## Rule-based optimization
The (non-experimental) optimization of query plans is done with a heuristic rule-based planner.
Raco provides many useful rules in `raco/rules.py`. `Rule` is the super class of all rules. 

### How optimization works
A physical algebra provides an implementation of `opt_rules`, which just returns an ordered list
of rules to apply. The optimizer applies each rule breadth first to the entire query plan tree, in the order specified by the list.
This algorithm is very simplistic, but it works out okay right now.

### How to add a rule
1. first, just check that the rule you need or something very close doesn't already exist in `raco/rules.py` or one of the languages in `raco/language/*.py`. If it is a generic rule and you find it in one of the languages, please [submit a pull request]( moving it to `raco/rules.py`https://github.com/uwescience/raco/compare).
2. If adding a rule, subclass `Rule` from `raco/rules.py`. You must implemented two methods: `_str_` and `fire`.
`fire` checks if the rule is applicable to the given tree. If not then it should return the tree itself. If the rule does apply then `fire` should return a transformed tree. It is okay to mutate the input tree and return it: most of Raco's rules are currently doing this instead of keeping the input immutable and copying the whole tree.
3. Go to your algebra (e.g., `MyriaLeftDeepJoinAlgebra` in `raco/language/myrialang.py`) and instantiate your rule somewhere in the list returned by `opt_rules`.

### Example plan manipulation
Often users of MyriaX want to partition a table. This can be done by scan the relation, shuffle, store. MyriaL query language does not have a Shuffle operator (they only get introduced by joins, groupbys, and set operations); however we can still easily build the query plan we want. Here is an example of using MyriaX shuffle to partition a table in the MyMergerTree astronomy application.

[vulcan.py catalog is here](https://gist.github.com/bmyerz/8fe4107eb8faff6221e8)

```python
from raco.catalog import FromFileCatalog
import raco.myrial.parser as parser
import raco.myrial.interpreter as interpreter
import raco.algebra as alg
from raco.expression.expression import UnnamedAttributeRef

# get the schema
catalog = FromFileCatalog.load_from_file("vulcan.py")
_parser = parser.Parser()

# We can have Raco start us with a plan that is close to the one we want by giving it a MyriaL query.
# Here we start with scan, store. We'll modify it to get scan, shuffle, store.
statement_list = _parser.parse("T1 = scan(public:vulcan:edgesConnected);store(T1, public:vulcan:edgesConnectedSort);")
processor = interpreter.StatementProcessor(catalog, True)
processor.evaluate(statement_list)

# we will add the shuffle into the logical plan
p = processor.get_logical_plan()

# This is the actual plan manipulation; just insert a Shuffle. Since the
# operators are all unary (single-input) this just looks like linked-list insertion.
tail = p.args[0].input
p.args[0].input = alg.Shuffle(tail, [UnnamedAttributeRef(0), UnnamedAttributeRef(1), UnnamedAttributeRef(3)])
                                    # Shuffle columns

# output json query plan for MyriaX
p = processor.get_physical_plan()
p = processor.get_json()
print p
```
